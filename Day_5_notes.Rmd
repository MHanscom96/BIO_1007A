### Entering the tidyverse (dplyr)
### 23 January 2023
### MFH

### tidyverse: collection of packages that share philosophy, grammar (or how the code is structured), and data structures

## Operators: symbols that tell R to perform different operations (between variables, functions, etc.)

## Arithmetic operators: + - * / ^ ~
## Assignment operator: <-
## Logical operators: ! & |
## Relational operators: == != > < >= <=
## Miscellaneous operators: %>% (forward pipe operator) %in%

### only need to install packages once

library(tidyverse) #library function to load in packages
library(dplyr)

# dplyr: new(er) packages provides a set of tools for manipulating data sets
# specifically written to be fast
# individual functions that correspond to common operations

#### The Core Verbs
## filter()
## arrange()
## select()
## group_by() and summarize()
## mutate()

## built in data set
data(starwars)
class(starwars)
glimpse(starwars)

## Tibble: modern take on data frames
# great aspects of dfs and drops frustrating ones (change variables)


### NAs
anyNA(starwars) #is.na # complete.cases
#starwarsClean <- starwars[complete.cases(starwars[,1:10])]
#anyNA(starwarsClean[,1:10])

### filter(): picks/subsets observations (ROWS) by their values

filter(starwars, gender == "masculine" & height < 180 & height > 100)

#### %in% operator (matching); similar == but you can compare vectors of different length
#sequence of letters
a <- LETTERS[1:10]
length(a)

b <- LETTERS[4:10]
length(b)

## output of %in% depends on first vector
a %in% b
b %in% a

# use %in% to subset
eyes <- filter(starwars, eye_color %in% c("blue", "brown"))
#View(eyes)

#### arrange(): reorders rows
arrange(starwars, by=height) #default is ascending order
# can use helper function desc()
arrange(starwars, by=desc(height))

arrange(starwars, height, desc(mass)) # second variable used to break ties

sw <- arrange(starwars, by=height)
tail(sw) # missing values are at the end

#### select(): chooses variables (COLUMNS) by their names
select(starwars, 1:10)
select(starwars, name:species)
select(starwars, -(films:starships))
starwars[,1:11]

## Rearange columns
select(starwars, name, gender, species, everything()) #everything is a helper function; useful if you have a couple of variables you want to move to the beginning

# contains() helper function
select(starwars, contains ("color"))
# others include: ends_with(), starts_with(), num_range()

## select can also rename columns
select(starwars, haircolor = hair_color) # returns only renamed columns
rename(starwars, haircolor = hair_color) # returns whole df

#### mutate(): creates new variables using functions of existing variables
# let's creare a new column that is height divided by mass
mutate(starwars, ratio = height/mass)

starwars_lbs <- mutate(starwars, mass_lbs = mass*2.2)
starwars_lns <- select(starwars_lbs, 1:3, mass_lbs, everything())
glimpse(starwars_lbs) # brought it to the front sing select

# transmute
transmute(starwars, mass_lbs = mass*2.2) # only returns mutated columns
transmute(starwars, mass, mass_lbs= mass*2.2, height)

#### group_by() and summarize()
summarize(starwars, meanHeight = mean(height, na.rm=T)) #throws NA if any NAs are in df - need to use na.rm=T

summarize(starwars, meanHeight = mean(height, na.rm=T), TotalNumber = n())

# use group_by() for maximum usefulness
starwarsGenders <- group_by(starwars, gender)
head(starwarsGenders)

summarize(starwarsGenders, meanHeight = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), TotalNumber = n())

# Piping %>%
# used to emphasize a sequence of actions
# allows you to pass an intermediate result onto the next function (uses output of one function as input of next function)
# avoid if you need to manipulate more than one object/ variable at a time; or if variable is meaningful
# formatting: should always have a space before the %>% followed by a new line

starwars %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(meanHeight=mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), TotalNumber=n())

## case_when() is useful for multiple if/ifelse statements
#starwars %>%
  #mutate(sp = case_when(species == "Human" ~ "Human", TRUE ~ "Non-Human")) # uses condition, puts "Human" if True in sp column, puts "Non-Human" if it's FALSE
