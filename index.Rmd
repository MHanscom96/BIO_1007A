## About Me

Hi! My name is Max and this is my website for my J-term class *Reproducible Biology in R*.  I'm a senior thesis student in the Geology department at Middlebury College currently working on my thesis project focused on Appalachian Mountain Building around 450 million years ago.  In my free time I like to ski and I play on the college's frisbee team; the Middlebury Pranksters.  Check out my projects for this class below!
